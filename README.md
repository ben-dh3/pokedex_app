# Pokedex React Application

Type the name of the Pokemon you want to find in the search bar, the SearchPokedex component fetches the data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and is formatted in the FormatData component.

Currently displays data including: image, name, height, weight, type, abilities, stats. 

In the future I intend to include a description of the abilities.

# How to Run the Project

- Install dependencies:

  `npm i`

- Run the development server:
